          <p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been looking at &ldquo;house and lot&rdquo; real estate around the Metro. At most, the figure floating in our heads is around 8M-9M PHP. To loan that amount to a bank and to pay it off for 20 years I have to:</p>

<ul><li>Have Annual 2.4M PHP Income (Around 160k PHP Monthly Income)</li>
<li>Pay 48,500 PHP in 20 years</li>
</ul><p>That&rsquo;s a big number to hit, and to be honest, I get overwhelmed by it.</p>

<p>But I am reminded of one thing:</p>

<p>Aiming to &ldquo;build a house&rdquo; between &ldquo;making a home&rdquo; are two different things.</p>

<p>Keeping that in mind, strive to make happy memories instead of zoning out for the next 5-10 years trying to make more money.</p>

<p>Anxiously waiting to hit your financial goals, looking forward to pay days and stressing out to make more money will not &ldquo;make a home&rdquo;. The only memories you&rsquo;ll imprint on your wife and children will be of a man who always arrived home thinking of business and cash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Building a house&rdquo; is only part of &ldquo;making a home&rdquo;, not the other way around. Ask God to help you balance the emotions out, you don&rsquo;t even need to ask Him for money. Have faith, He basically got your back already.</p>

<p>He already got you married right?</p>
