title: My useful secret projects
---

Developers are craftsmen. They build things for a living. As a side effect, they'll try to build a lot of things that they need or want for themselves. A handful, to an extent, dreams to run a business around what they've built. Most fail, not because they didn't have enough time or it didn't have enough features (trust me, we can build a lot of unwanted features). The main reason most fail is no one knows about the things they've built in the first place, and no one uses them, even themselves.

I know how most developers feel, because I'm a developer myself.

## My useful secret projects

This is a paradox. Obviously, my projects will not be useful to other people if it's kept in secret, sitting in a shelf. Moreover, it will not be "finished", because "finished" is a vague finish line unless someone uses it.

I've decided to turn a new leaf this year, and just open them all up for everyone. I'll categorize the projects under the target people that are meant to use them.

- Non-techies - these are people who are not developers and for general use
- Techies - these are people who are in the tech industry

Just message me directly if any of you guys would desperately need to use any of these projects. Let's talk it out.

### Techies

Endpointy - a POST endpoint for static websites

### Non-Techies

Pouchnote
Quoteplate
Balikan
Filemailup
