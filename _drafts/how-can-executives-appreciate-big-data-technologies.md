title: How can Executives 'appreciate' Big Data Technologies?
---

I get that question from some of my officemates. How can people appreciate "Big Data". Is there a demo to make people appreciate "Big Data" or "Hadoop"? How can we sell "Data Lakes vs Data Warehouses".

### Value: Bottom-up approach

You can't appreciate something without knowing it's value and what it actually is.  It's like saying "How can Executives appreciate PHP Lavarel?". 

It's hard to sell PHP Developers and Data Analysts need to appreciate.

Demos with fancy charts, won't work on most businesses: "Hey, our current Oracle Database can do that. What's new?"

You have to hit the developers, the CTO, the technical team. Make a compelling demo that seemingly makes their lives easier.
