# Man and Machine Take On Big Data

> The other buzzword that epitomizes a bias toward substitution is "big data". Today's companies have an insatiable appetite for data, mistakenly believing that more data always creates more value. But big data is usually dumb data. Computers can find patterns that elude humans, but they don't know how to compare patterns from different sources or how to interpret complex behaviors. Actionable insights can only come from a human analyst (or the kind of generalized artificial intelligence that exists only in science fiction). We have let ourselves become enchanted by big data only because we exoticize technology.

Peter Thiel's nails it in the head when companies talk about Big Data and how it'll help them, treating Big Data as some sort of black box technology where you put in your data and actionable insights come out. This hits home on me as a programmer.

Drilled down to the basics, Big Data technologies such as Hadoop are tools used by developers and analysts to store data, run jobs and analytics on a cheaper and grander scale. Big Data is just a fluff term for "Distributed Computing", much like "Cloud" is "Remote Servers bundled with Web Applications and Web Services".
