title: Why is the SpaceX Falcon 9 landing so important?
---

You've probably heard it somewhere in your facebook feed:

> SpaceX has successfully landed the Falcon 9.

People are trumpeting it as a historical event, one that would be remembered hundreds of years from now. No one will remember which faction won in the Middle East 500 years from now, but the landing of the Falcon 9 would be.

*Is it that important?*

Very important, actually. To put it simply here's what SpaceX has achieved:

They launched a rocket in space, and brought a large part of it back in earth safely for reuse. 

*Why is that a biggie?*

Currently, to launch a rocket in space you'll need to burn a lot of fuel to launch yourself up into orbit. In order to store that fuel somewhere, you'll need to have a bigger fuel tank, larger fuel tank, larger engines. It's a vicious cycle to fight gravity.

As your rocket goes higher, the difference in gravity doesnt change a lot. That's why Rockets are designed to collapse, to make them lighter so they could escape Earth's gravity. This is the reason why it's expensive to get into space.
