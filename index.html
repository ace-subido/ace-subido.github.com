        <p><em>A little note:</em> Developers are craftsmen. They build things for a living. As a side effect, they’ll try to build a lot of things that they need or want for themselves. A handful, to an extent, dreams to run a business around what they’ve built. Most fail, not because they didn’t have enough time or it didn’t have enough features (trust me, we can build a lot of unwanted features). The main reason most fail is no one knows about the things they’ve built in the first place, and no one uses them, even themselves.</p>

        <p>I get that question from some of my officemates. How can people appreciate “Big Data Technologies”. Is there a demo to make people appreciate “Big Data” or “Hadoop”? How can we sell “Data Lakes vs Data Warehouses”.</p>

        <blockquote>
  <p>I’m 17 years old (turning 18 on August, 2016), i’m still studying college (my 1st year) and at the same time, doing freelance designing. I earn 20-30k php per month sa designs ko. So far so good naman, kayang i-balance ang study at freelance work.
Been doing this since 2012, thanks to my designs, i was able to buy things i want and i need. Now comes a point na halos ok na ko sa mga meron ako, and iniisip ko kung paano ko ma-save ang pera ko. Wala naman ako alam sa mga investments/stocks/etc dahil ang course ko ay Multimedia Arts. Tried searching online about sa stock market but i dont think i have the knowledge para pasukin yun.
What’s the best way para ma-save ko ang money ko at hindi ako bili ng bili ng mga not-so-important stuff? I don’t want to be broke when i grow up, so i want to save these money :)</p>

        <p>It’s been a few weeks/months since I’ve been plunged into this “Big Data” ecosystem, all I could sense was that
“Big Data” is a marketing term for problems that require “Distributed Frameworks” as solutions, much like how “Cloud” is a marketing term for how “Remote Servers” are provisioned.</p>
