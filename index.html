        <p>So, I’m in the process of trying to get the best performance out of our internet setup at home. I’ve worked with Network Architects and ansible’d network configurations for large Hadoop clusters the frequently transfer terabytes, but sadly, I haven’t sat down and fixed our internet at home. I’m a software engineer, and no means a hardcore Cisco Certified Network Engineer, so I decided to sit on this problem and improve our situation.</p>

        <p>I frequently work with a large ruby application, and whenever I run <code>rspec path/to/single_unit_test.rb</code> in a Rails application, it takes 2-3 seconds before the test starts. This is because of the amount of source files that are involved in the application. Fortunately, Shopify released a gem called <a href="https://github.com/shopify/bootsnap"><code>bootsnap</code></a>.</p>

        <p>There are countless blog posts and stack overflow explanations about this, figured I need to write this little note for myself. To start things off, check this example of computing PHPKRW using hypothetical gold as a go-between:</p>

        <p>Elections is coming, and to be honest, I had to install a chrome filter to block out my feeds from certain keywords. Visiting CNN Philippines and Rappler, the past few weeks had me realizing one thing: everyone needs a savior.</p>

        <p><em>A little note:</em> Developers are craftsmen. They build things for a living. As a side effect, they’ll try to build a lot of things that they need or want for themselves. A handful, to an extent, dreams to run a business around what they’ve built. Most fail, not because they didn’t have enough time or it didn’t have enough features (trust me, we can build a lot of unwanted features). The main reason most fail is no one knows about the things they’ve built in the first place, and no one uses them, even themselves.</p>

        <p>I get that question from some of my officemates. How can people appreciate “Big Data Technologies”. Is there a demo to make people appreciate “Big Data” or “Hadoop”? How can we sell “Data Lakes vs Data Warehouses”.</p>

        <p>It’s been a few weeks/months since I’ve been plunged into this “Big Data” ecosystem, all I could sense was that
“Big Data” is a marketing term for problems that require “Distributed Frameworks” as solutions, much like how “Cloud” is a marketing term for how “Remote Servers” are provisioned.</p>
