        <title>Where to invest my money? I&#39;m 17 years old ....</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m 17 years old (turning 18 on August, 2016), i’m still studying college (my 1st year) and at the same time, doing freelance designing. I earn 20-30k php per month sa designs ko. So far so good naman, kayang i-balance ang study at freelance work.
Been doing this since 2012, thanks to my designs, i was able to buy things i want and i need. Now comes a point na halos ok na ko sa mga meron ako, and iniisip ko kung paano ko ma-save ang pera ko. Wala naman ako alam sa mga investments/stocks/etc dahil ang course ko ay Multimedia Arts. Tried searching online about sa stock market but i dont think i have the knowledge para pasukin yun.
What’s the best way para ma-save ko ang money ko at hindi ako bili ng bili ng mga not-so-important stuff? I don’t want to be broke when i grow up, so i want to save these money :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve put together a handy-dandy handbook/guide for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, before anything, remove all debt. Zero out your credit card balance on the things you just bought. “Financial freedom” is only attained when you have no debt. Someone who nets 20-30K PHP per month but doesn’t have debt, has more “financial freedom” than someone who nets 150K PHP yet has a large chunk of debt and lives under stress of knowing they owe someone money.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, change your mindset in purchases. The best way to save your money is not some list of things to do, but rather, a radical change of mindset: don’t let material possessions define your identity. Define “need to have” and “nice to have”. Ask yourself “what do I value?” whenever you feel you’re about to purchase something stupid. Do you really need a moleskine for mockups? Is buying another cup of Starbucks really that important? Do I really need a new pair of shoes? Get your parents to help you in this. Another set of eyes definitely helps. You’re young, so don’t worry about getting broke and spending your savings, worry about what you’re actually spending your money on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, is the most important one, if you do this and #2, you can easily get #4: Change your mindset on the word “investment”. Money is a device to exchange value, it is not a source of wealth, it will run out on you. So, technically, the best “investment” is putting more money on what currently earns you money: your skill. Buy a book from a famous designer, attend FFC, engage the design community and the market, spend more money/time experimenting and working on your own project, instead of doing something else. This mindset will increase how much you earn in amounts that you will not foresee.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should I do this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Think of a rich person, one who gained their riches from great skill. If you took away their “businesses”, “investments” and “savings”, they probably won’t have a problem. Sure they’ll get hurt badly, but they can recover from a bankruptcy. The reason is because they’ve invested highly in themselves and are highly skilled. With their skill, they’ve attained a good professional network and they can easily recover from brutal bankruptcies. Their “investments” (stocks/mutual funds/etc.) are just overflow, fruits, of their true investment: their skill.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On the opposite, research about lottery winners who ironically got bankrupted. Take note: some of them even had “funds and investments”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you ever got broke, you can confidently get back up due to reputation, discipline in purchases and skill.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, the only time you “invest” or pour money into “investments/funds”, is when income is already overflowing against your expenses. The best gauge for that is when you’ve 1) attained the usual “3-6 months of income as savings” and 2) at least being able to save more than 30-50% of your monthly net. A well-maintained bank account is a sign of debtlessness, discipline in purchases, and overflow. This makes you liquid, allowing you to shift wealth to where you need it (emergencies, travel, skill investment, etc.). It’s the reason why a lot of people over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://reddit.com/r/personalfinance&quot;&gt;/r/personalfinance&lt;/a&gt; suggests to work on a savings account first.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fifth, after you’ve changed your mindset, proven you can manage your finances with a good bank account, then you can get your hands dirty with “investments” while improving your skill:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Get medical insurance first, your parents will jump for joy when you get this for yourself. Head over to Blue Cross or Medicard. Basic medical coverage from Medicard hover around 8.9K PHP/year (700PHP~ per month).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Get life insurance that also doubles as an investment fund (SunLife is a safe bet, PruLife has nice offerings that has medical coverage infused with it).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Lastly, pick an Index Fund. BPI offers the Philippine Equity Index Fund. BDO has this as well. Whichever you like, they both perform very well.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ano yung Index Fund?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In much simpler terms: Ever see a picture or a huge chart in the business/finance section of a media website or a newspaper? The one that says “Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index”? An Index Fund tries to closely follow those numbers. In laymans terms: You give money to a company, say BPI. The company would have fund managers that pick and trade stocks which closely matches the companies in that huge chart. So, when you see that the “Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index” went up by 2% in one month, you can safely assume that the money you placed in BPI went up at about 1.25%-1.5% for that month as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ang daming mga iba pang funds diba? Why an Index Fund? Why not a mutual fund or treasury bills? Ano difference nila?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’ll explain as simple as possible:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Treasury bills are government-based. You give the government money, they turn it into government projects which earns them money, which they use to pay you back with interest. T-bills as they call it are for the paranoid; they’re ultra-safe. Unless the Senate voted to turn itself into a strip club and Malacanang is burning with gasoline, your money is safe from anything else in the world. Besides if it came to that, money might not be important anymore in the Philippines anyway; you’d have to rely on your skill to live or learn farming to feed yourself. However, with the safety, comes a huge cost (minimum is 200K on PNB, returns per year are very small, expect a 10-20 year return)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Mutual funds are a pool of money from different people: they hire a professional stock broker or fund manager which trades for them. Mutual funds have higher transaction fees than Index Funds. From a personal experience, only a few mutual funds/companies have beaten or come close to the Index, and the really good ones are pretty expensive and complicated to enter into.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, again, why an Index Fund?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A NYTimes article called the American-based “Vanguard Index Fund” as the “bread-and-butter index fund for the individual”. Index Funds are a gateway to the stock market and opens up your mind about it. It’s “the vanilla ice cream of finance”. They have low transaction fees, they’re easy to understand, doesn’t require much commitment and as “passive” as you make it. They’re not as safe though, when a “market crash” happens, everyone gets pulled down, especially Index Funds. Don’t worry; what goes down usually goes back up, people usually get great returns from Index funds when they hold them for 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you’re not earning millions per year and just starting out on investments, this is your go to.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;BPI Express Online and BDO Online Banking integrates tightly with their index funds. You can easily top up and cash out straight from/to your bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On picking and trading stocks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It actively requires “skill”. Picking and trading stocks is a skillset to be learned. You have to be up to date, and you need to pick your companies well and do your research on them. If you really want to improve on that skill, head over to COL Financial to get a grasp of things. It doesn’t matter if COL is good/not-good based on the opinion of other people, what matters is you get started.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Personally I don’t advise this path, unless you really want to build a career as a really good trader. You’re already good at design, so don’t lose focus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Few reminders: Don’t get arrogant. Don’t be in a hurry to make more money. Don’t be in a hurry. Period. Take time to get better with your work, don’t rush it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>What is a Real Time Analytics Platform?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a few weeks/months since I’ve been plunged into this “Big Data” ecosystem, all I could sense was that
“Big Data” is a marketing term for problems that require “Distributed Frameworks” as solutions, much like how “Cloud” is a marketing term for how “Remote Servers” are provisioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard the word “Real Time Analytics Platform” thrown around a lot, but what does that really mean? What is that anyway? What is Real Time Analytics? And what is a Real Time Analytics Platform?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think people forgot it’s meaning as time passes by, so let’s get down to what it really means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real Time Analytics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakdown: Analytics is the discovery of meaningful patterns in data. Real Time adds “immediacy”. The combination of both means that “Real Time Analytics” is discovering meaningful patterns in data for something urgent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outage map for a utility company that is updated immediately&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Target push at customers on geofence detection for retail&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fraud detection systems for finance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emergencies such as forest fires and emergency call recordings for government owned utilities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social program fraud detection for government agencies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Log analysis for bad patterns in high-tech companies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anonymised usage patterns for telco’s (if they want to sell it as data or use for internal analytics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some example use cases that are urgent and require immediate attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create an environment where you can do “Real Time Analytics”, you’d need to safely work with 3 aspects of how your data flows into your system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Input - an event happens (new sale, new customer, someone enters a geofence, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Process and Store Input - capture the data of the event, and analyze the data without leveraging resources that are dedicated to operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Output - consume this data without disturbing operations (reports, dashboard, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2nd and 3rd bullet is very important. It requires extensive use of background processes to achieve low-latency and high throughput to provide real time characteristics. In programming, we’ve all been taught to put really expensive operations behind another process/thread  (Resque/Sidekiq, micro-services architecture) instead of blocking everything until the operation is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like a normal controller class in a web app, it’s not that complex and handling this won’t be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then again, let’s take for example, a typical megacorporation. They’d procured the usual .NET/Oracle/SAP stack (as much as possible, no cloud, they’re following some sort of security protocol).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide “Real Time Analytics”, usually they’d have a plethora of ETL Background Processes/Workers with Excel/DB integrations, per department, running on any number of servers, each having their own fault-tolerance and scaling strategies. If the data requirements change, they’d have to go through this set of intertwined systems and change each one of them, make sure they don’t crash and push the changes back to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A normal controller class won’t cut it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real Time Analytics Platform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our sample megacorporation, that current mosaic of stuff is their “Real Time Analytics Platform”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, that setup will not help. It’s not real-time unless it happens instantly!” - just to sidetrack a little bit; this actually won’t happen. Many multi-department companies want to achieve that vague finish line called “Real Time Analytics” with a “Single Customer View” inside a room with a lot of screens displaying tons of dashboards. You got to define those things clearly first to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latency is as low as we can make it, but it’s not just the speed, it’s also the extensibility where you can easily change those set of intertwined systems based on requirements, which would probably change a lot during such a big undertaking. All departments should be together to work on this, or else it won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s a great team at the megacorp; chances are, they’ll use bits and pieces of frameworks here and there instead of having a mosaic of stuff to help you get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not, they’ll be reinventing a set of rules and guiding principles on code; how to scale, fault-tolerance, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ll be reinventing a framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard enough to get great people to work with, but it’s harder if they’re working on this mosaic of apps that doesn’t have a solid framework. There are many good frameworks lying around, so learn the frameworks and leverage it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, the frameworks that help blot out bullet point #2 are what people sell as “Real Time Analytics Platform”’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS: So, what’s a good one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I won’t endorse anything. Acquiring something that would solve something complex without knowing what really needs to be done will end badly. Ask the tech team first, they’d probably know.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Making a home</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at &amp;ldquo;house and lot&amp;rdquo; real estate around the Metro. At most, the figure floating in our heads is around 8M-9M PHP. To loan that amount to a bank and to pay it off for 20 years I have to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have Annual 2.4M PHP Income (Around 160k PHP Monthly Income)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay 48,500 PHP in 20 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a big number to hit, and to be honest, I get overwhelmed by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am reminded of one thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aiming to &amp;ldquo;build a house&amp;rdquo; between &amp;ldquo;making a home&amp;rdquo; are two different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping that in mind, strive to make happy memories instead of zoning out for the next 5-10 years trying to make more money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anxiously waiting to hit your financial goals, looking forward to pay days and stressing out to make more money will not &amp;ldquo;make a home&amp;rdquo;. The only memories you&amp;rsquo;ll imprint on your wife and children will be of a man who always arrived home thinking of business and cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Building a house&amp;rdquo; is only part of &amp;ldquo;making a home&amp;rdquo;, not the other way around. Ask God to help you balance the emotions out, you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to ask Him for money. Have faith, He basically got your back already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He already got you married right?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What do you wish you had known before you turned 40?</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;What do you wish you had known before you turned 40?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Practice is the key to getting better at everything. Ignore the concept of innate talent or gift. People who are good are good because they spent a lot of time practicing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who practice a lot usually do so because they’re interested in it. It’s not hard or homework for them. If there’s a gift, it’s the gift of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artists copy a lot. They don’t come up with stuff clear out of their heads. They look at a lot of things, keep a lot of references, and blend ideas together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people who are famous are so not because they’re good, but because they’ve worked hard to become famous. It was important to them, so they did what it took to become famous. Being good at something is a small part of that, small enough that famous people aren’t usually all that good. Their time was better spent becoming famous. (This is the biggest lesson from this list. It basically implies that you can ignore people who have blogs and podcasts. Seek out the unknown experts in your field.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t make decisions based on money. Don’t stay at a job because the shares might be worth something, or because the company might get acquired. These things rarely happen and you can’t get your time back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is totally winging it all the time. Confident people are just better at hiding it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>&quot;What is your stack?&quot;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rails, and all the Ruby ecosystem has to offer, coupled with Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a project becomes even more complicated and it looks as if Rails with Resque/Sidekiq won&amp;rsquo;t cut it, I go with what we (team on any project) all decide to use for certain parts of the stack. Whether that be Ember/Backbone/Angular on the front or Scala/Go for certain workers, Debian or CentOS on the server, etc. or what not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal preference won&amp;rsquo;t mean anything if a project goes bigger than me. I value working with other people over technology choices, even if the collectively-decided pieces of the stack were a little different from my own stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving you only to work with even-numbered columns for perfectly centered content inside a bootstrap column:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; .col-md-offset-2.col-md-8
 .col-md-offset-3.col-md-6
 .col-md-offset-4.col-md-4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foundation has built-in centered columns, so here&amp;rsquo;s a way to create centered bootstrap columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; // SCSS
 .col-center {
   float: none;
   margin-right: auto;
   margin-left: auto;
 }

 // HAML
 .container
    .row
       .col-md-5.col-center
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see this in action, just take a look &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/ace-subido/pen/MYVNBv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidenote: this works with Bootstrap 3.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stargazing in Manila: How, Where, When, Who</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I love the actuality of space. The thought that if you go up high enough, there&amp;rsquo;s a vast expanse beyond the sky. Back then, as a kid, this was the cause for majority of my daydreaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remembered the time in my high school where our teacher arranged for a stargazing session. It was an all-nighter thing with the entire science club. The only thing in my recollection; it was the first time I saw a planet right in front of my eyes. Not those planets you see in textbooks, the one rendered by artists, but a real one, as real as the pencil you have in your hand. It&amp;rsquo;s just there, reflected on a piece of glass attached to a telescope. The thought of space is amazing, but seeing that right there before my eyes blew my 14-year old mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I also recollected: it was the PAGASA UP Observatory in Diliman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night back in 2012, I went there with my wife and 3 other friends :) Long story short, they all had fun :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more long prose, here are some details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the number for that UP Observatory - 929-1237&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com.ph/maps/@14.6509404,121.0721939,19z?hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;hellip;and a map to where it is&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;annndddd also a picture of the building (credits for the photo goes to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/astronomy/astronomy-in-the-philippines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PAGASA&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;img src=&quot;http://38.media.tumblr.com/b7d4d8f45eb7158b88388d467c2520f8/tumblr_inline_nfsllkRlFG1rqf6g8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon calling the number, ask if they can accommodate you and if the place is not busy for the night. If it&amp;rsquo;s not busy, ask for the forecast before you go there, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go there all excited only to find out no planets are visible and the skies aren&amp;rsquo;t clear. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember you can&amp;rsquo;t book the &amp;ldquo;viewing of the cosmos&amp;rdquo; in advance like some special food in your favourite restaurant. You&amp;rsquo;re just hoping that most of the things you want to see are there and the skies are clear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending on the planets you want to see, be prepared for an all-nighter, Go there after 7pm or 8pm, prepare to stay up as late as 2am depending on the things you want to view. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We brought food, water, stayed in our cars, listened to music, cleaned up after ourselves and kept quiet to pay respect to the place. Noisy and rowdy people will probably get a lot of unwanted attention from the campus security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can rent their telescopes, if I recall correctly, you can rent each for below 50PHP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask nicely, you&amp;rsquo;ll get help from them in finding a planet. Trust me, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t handled a telescope before, they&amp;rsquo;re hard to find.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The planets are moving targets since the earth is rotating, they&amp;rsquo;re smaller than a grain of sand compared to the entire expanse of the sky.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PAGASA staff that was helping us out even gave us a friendly challenge to find the moon. It&amp;rsquo;s not as easy as we all thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I offered to pay them extra because seriously, the experience is worth more than 20PHP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here&amp;rsquo;s a shot of the moon from my wife&amp;rsquo;s iPhone4s pointed directly at the viewfinder of a telescope.&lt;/p&gt;
