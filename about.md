Just keeping this short (since I really find it awkward to write a bio of myself)

- I'm a christian. This is who I am. I am a husband to a wonderful woman named [Elain Ojeda-Subido](http://elainojeda.com)
- I make software. This is what I do. Engineer, Senior Developer, Research and Development Manager, Senior Product Engineer, UX Designer, Technepreneur; all of those are just titles for some specific thing I once did, or am still doing. I currently work at [AGSX](http://agsx.net).

I am on [Github](http://github.com/ace-subido) and [Codepen](http://codepen.io/ace-subido). You can reach me at hello@acesubido.com
