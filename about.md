Just keeping this short (since I really find it awkward to write a bio of myself)

- I make software. This is what I do. Engineer, Senior Developer, Research and Development Manager, Senior Product Engineer, UX designer, Technepreneur; all of those are just titles for some specific thing I once did, or am still doing. I like to belive that I produce value for people.
- I'm a christian. This is who I am. The very fabric of my life stems from a constant reminder of the gospel. My relationship with God overflows to how I relate with people, how I mess up and God gets to put me back together to do better, the workings of my role as a child to my parents and to my siblings, how my role as a husband works and how my marriage goes, how to I try to be socially responsible, how I provide excellence at work; how I live my life.
- I am on [Github](http://github.com/ace-subido) and [Codepen](http://codepen.io/ace-subido). You can also follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/acesubido), link up with me on [LinkedIn](http://ph.linkedin.com/pub/ace-subido/61/77a/43b), and you can reach me at hello@acesubido.com
