        <p>There&rsquo;s this movie called &ldquo;Jerry Maguire&rdquo;, with a scene where Jerry Maguire bursts into a room looking for his wife whom he had a falling out with. With a company breakthrough he had, he wanted to celebrate that achievement with her more than anything. He missed his wife. I think it&rsquo;s a great scene, it&rsquo;s fitting, it&rsquo;s a good display of how a man should enjoy being with his wife.</p>

        <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/bleikamp/sass-at-github/">How SASS is being used at Github</a><br/><p>Recently switched from LESS to SASS, I have only a few reasons such as SASS having the ability to create very intelligent mixins via if/else statements, Compass/Bourbon vs elements.less and the @extend capability of SASS. Here&rsquo;s a great link on how to manage SASS projects in a large team.</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s quite hard to measure what&rsquo;s worthy in the span of our human lives. We invent a lot of devices to measure <em>what&rsquo;s with worth and what&rsquo;s without worth</em>.</p>
