        </div>
        <p>It&rsquo;s already November and I didn&rsquo;t realize how God has been really good: Left my old job, got married to my first-and-last girlfriend, went to Malaysia, settled down in a house, got a new job that enhanced my skills in a way I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend, shaved my head, grew a beard so long arabians thought I was arabian, experienced our first hospital check-in, ate at new places, met new people, went to Boracay, turned 26, killed a swarm of roaches, attended our first couples getaway, went to Baguio, did cycling for a few months, experienced our first tropical storm as a married couple, bought our first christmas tree and finally, I learned a lot &ndash; and this year hasn&rsquo;t ended yet :)</p>

        </div>
        <p>There&rsquo;s this movie called &ldquo;Jerry Maguire&rdquo;, with a scene where Jerry Maguire bursts into a room looking for his wife whom he had a falling out with. With a company breakthrough he had, he wanted to celebrate that achievement with her more than anything. He missed his wife. I think it&rsquo;s a great scene, it&rsquo;s fitting, it&rsquo;s a good display of how a man should enjoy being with his wife.</p>

        <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/bleikamp/sass-at-github/">How SASS is being used at Github</a><br/><p>Recently switched from LESS to SASS, I have only a few reasons such as SASS having the ability to create very intelligent mixins via if/else statements, Compass/Bourbon vs elements.less and the @extend capability of SASS. Here&rsquo;s a great link on how to manage SASS projects in a large team.</p>
