        <p>Whenever any developer creates software within a certain level of complexity, it requires a certain environment required for the application. 
If you were building a certain Rails app that had Resque on it, you&rsquo;ll need to install Redis on computer, if it&rsquo;s using MySQL or a certain flavor of an SQL database, you&rsquo;d also need to install it. If it has environment files or other 3rd party software needed to run (i.e. ImageMagick, etc.) you&rsquo;ll also need to install those.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m working on a simple expense/income tracker that me and my wife can use. Excel sheets/templates and other finance apps are way too complicated, we both agreed that in the end accounting is as simple as taking down notes in a ledger &ndash; why not enter those entries just as easy as tweeting (categorize expense/income in hashtags, etc.)</p>

        <blockquote>
  <p>I&rsquo;m 50.
  I&rsquo;ve been building hardware and programming since I was 18.</p>
  
  <p>I live in the Santa Clarita, CA.</p>
  
  <p>College was touch-and-go. It was always going too slow for me. By age 20 I was working as an engineer doing both hardware and software. At age 24 I had saved-up enough to buy my first house. I had a good career and was soon making over $100K per year doing the stuff I really enjoyed.</p>
  
  <p>I eventually started a tech business in my garage. Within three years it grew out of the garage and into a good size industrial facility with a dozen employees or so, in-house SMT assembly, CNC machining, low volume manufacturing, etc.</p>
  
  <p>As is the case with most businesses, there were ups and downs.</p>
  
  <p>The economic implosion of 2008 caught me in a perfect storm that ultimately led to killing the business after a two year gut-wrenching attempt to save it any which way I could. At the end of 2010 I had to capitulate and let it die.</p>
  
  <p>Three years later. No job. I&rsquo;ve sent out hundreds of applications. Very few call-backs. I&rsquo;ve even lied and implied I have a degree just to see what might happen. No difference whatsoever. I had a recruiter tell me I scare the shit out of people because of the experience I have and the number of roles I&rsquo;ve played, from rank-and-file engineer to founder/entrepreneur, CEO, CTO, etc. And, he also said, reality is I cannot water-down my resume because my life is all over the Internet in one way or the other.</p>
  
  <p>The good news is that my wife is more than able to support our family and we&rsquo;ve been OK. No urgent financial needs at this point.</p>
  
  <p>The last three years have come with a lot of soul searching on my part. You go from knowing you can tackle any project anyone could care to place in front of you to thinking you are absolutely worthless. You navigate this imaginary line back and forth over time. Back and forth.</p>
  
  <p>I&rsquo;ve kept busy. I had dabbled in web and mobile development before but the bulk of my work &ndash;where most of my value in the business was found&ndash; was in high performance FPGA and embedded hardware and software development. I&rsquo;ve developed entire product lines from scratch on my own. I am no stranger to hard work.</p>
  
  <p>Not wanting to remain idle I decided I needed to shift away from doing hardware &ndash;due to how capital intensive it is&ndash; and focus on software. I jumped head first into web and mobile technologies did a few experimental websites and published a free iPhone app. Making money in the app store is hard.</p>
  
  <p>In the end, technology requires money. I&rsquo;ve made a little money here and there, enough to pay for servers and have a few thousand laying around for judicious experiments. I told myself I would never touch my wife&rsquo;s income for my experiments and have stayed true to that over the last three years.</p>
  
  <p>During this time I&rsquo;ve also logged hundreds of potential business ideas spanning the range from pure software to web, mobile, physical and hardware products. Most are admittedly bad. That&rsquo;s OK. I forced myself not to pre-judge anything. The other day I saw these guys on Shark Tank who sold over a million dollars in ugly sweaters. My prior self would have discounted that as a dumb product and a dumb idea. I try not to think that way any more. Lessons such as watching something like Instagram do what it did have taught me things I just didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
  
  <p>I have convinced myself I am not employable because of my past and my age. I never thought I&rsquo;d say something like that in my life. A past of constant learning, accomplishments, entrepreneurship, hard work and, yes, success and failure. And no degree. I can&rsquo;t rightly describe what this feels like.</p>
  
  <p>During dinner last night my wife said she wants me to focus on finishing a Bachelors and then a Masters starting next year. She said she doesn&rsquo;t care if I don&rsquo;t work during that time. She feels this will be good for me mentally and that it will/might bring opportunities to the table at one point or another.</p>
  
  <p>If you ask me today I am absolutely convinced that a degree will be useless to me. I&rsquo;ve tried to imply I had a degree in resumes just to see what would happen and it made zero difference. I&rsquo;ve also seen countless articles, some of which on HN, highlighting the fact that older engineers are having one hell of a time finding work, credentials or not. I don&rsquo;t know. It could take five years to get to a Masters in, say, CS. I&rsquo;ll be 55 years old, not having held a job for eight years and looking for work. How is that going to help me?</p>
  
  <p>My current view is that my only way out is through entrepreneurship. I need to keep trying until I hit upon something that works. I know I have a few potentially good ones but I don&rsquo;t have enough money to launch them correctly. I have to bootstrap from small ideas to larger ones.</p>
  
  <p>I tried a startup pitch competition. I the judges where real assholes to everyone, it was a regular &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see who&rsquo;s dick is longest&rdquo; fest. Not my scene. Regrettably. I also think a lot of VC&rsquo;s want young 20-somethings who will virtually kill themselves working. I can&rsquo;t neglect my family and simply can&rsquo;t live like that at this stage.</p>
  
  <p>Looking for thoughts, ideas, opinion. I am sure there&rsquo;s something I might be missing in my thought process. It&rsquo;d sure be nice to go back to feeling like a productive member of society as well as to contribute to the financial well-being of my family. The kids are getting older. It isn&rsquo;t going to get any cheaper.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks!</p>

  <p>Met this great team at a startup running a (quite successful) webapp on a cloud hosting provider. They don&rsquo;t test their code at all (and instead run through tests manually before they push to production).
  They say it&rsquo;s because they wanted to put something out there rather than focus on testing. Is that legit? I like them a lot, but it makes me nervous that they don&rsquo;t have any test framework in place. I think they&rsquo;re open to testing now they are more stable. Thoughts?</p>
