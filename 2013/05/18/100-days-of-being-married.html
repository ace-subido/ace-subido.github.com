    <p><strong>Hi &ldquo;2011 Ace&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to write to you today. I wanted to know how you are doing after all the things I&rsquo;ve heard from you since last time.</p>

<p>You told me you liked Elain, and you&rsquo;d want to take her out to dates and eventually get married. That&rsquo;s nice! It&rsquo;s kind of exciting isn&rsquo;t it? To have a &ldquo;girlfriend&rdquo;, I know that feeling. Knowing you, you&rsquo;d want to get married 3 to 5 years into the relationship. Until you get critical mass in your bank account and until you got to know her better, yep, that&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s pretty much you :) very calculative and deliberative. I&rsquo;m pretty sure you&rsquo;ve got it all figured out kung paano liligawan si Elain.</p>

<p>But I heard you got dumped by Elain.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry man. I know how that feels, there&rsquo;s a certain weight around your chest that you just can&rsquo;t seem to take out. One thing we both learned: things don&rsquo;t go our way, no matter how perfectly we planned it, because God always has His plan. It&rsquo;s a better plan, I assure you.</p>

<p>I wrote to you today because it&rsquo;s been 100+ days since I got married to Elain.</p>

<p>Surprised? Yeah, I was surprised too.</p>

<p>If you honestly ask me, the wedding feels like it was just yesterday, the proposal feels like it happened last week. Ace, it was beautiful and surreal. You got married at Barbara&rsquo;s, and you and Elain planned it. You wouldn&rsquo;t even imagine that plan at &ldquo;2011&rdquo;. Me and Elain are grateful to everyone who went to the wedding, grateful to our suppliers, grateful to our Ninongs and Ninangs, to our family and friends - and most of all, grateful to God.</p>

<p>You might be asking why we got married earlier. Well Ace, let&rsquo;s leave that for another interesting conversation :)</p>

<p>&ldquo;2011 Ace&rdquo;, If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve learned, it&rsquo;s that no matter how hopeless or impossible it seems, if it is from God - it will naturally happen. Nothing on earth can stop it. It was raining the day that you proposed to her, and yes, you made the girl of your dreams cry out of pure joy.</p>

<hr><p>A lot has changed here at 2013, the world, the country, the people around you and most especially, us. We&rsquo;ve changed - a lot. It&rsquo;s only been a hundred days so I&rsquo;m still adjusting, there&rsquo;s a God-given mantle upon us now as the head of the family. It&rsquo;s scary and exciting at the same time. So many changes in such a speck of time, to think that when we were 11 years old, a year seemed like eternity. Despite all the changes in this world, there&rsquo;s someone we both know who never changes -</p>

<p>God.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s been there for the both of us. 2 years ago and 2 years from now until the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine and until the earth would fade away. Right now, it seems dark on where you are - I assure you that better days will come so keep putting your faith in Him.</p>

<p>Always remember, His love never fails and never gives up. It&rsquo;ll never run out on you.</p>

<p><strong>From &ldquo;2013 Ace&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p><em>P.S.: I&rsquo;m also waiting for a letter from &ldquo;2018 Ace&rdquo; :)</em></p>
