    <p>There&rsquo;s this movie called &ldquo;Jerry Maguire&rdquo;, with a scene where Jerry Maguire bursts into a room looking for his wife whom he had a falling out with. With a company breakthrough he had, he wanted to celebrate that achievement with her more than anything. He missed his wife. I think it&rsquo;s a great scene, it&rsquo;s fitting, it&rsquo;s a good display of how a man should enjoy being with his wife.</p>

<p>Putting God in the center of a marriage cannot be stressed enough and it should be constantly reminded, enjoying the marriage comes second.</p>

<p>When we put Jesus above all else, there will be times that He tells us of the blessings we have as being joined together as husband and wife, and that in itself is already enjoyable.</p>

<p>If we do not enjoy each other, then we can be sure that the relationship will soon snowball into &ldquo;duty&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;love&rdquo;. How would it sound if I gave my wife flowers &ldquo;because I am her husband and I have to do this&rdquo; ? Sounds like I&rsquo;m doing &ldquo;work&rdquo; and fulfilling &ldquo;requirements&rdquo;, but if I gave her flowers because it is backed up with my love and desire for her &ndash; wanting to joyfully own up to that love becomes a different story.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.edsonandina.com/" target="_blank">I saw this kind of joy in a couple, at their wedding I attended last October 16, 2013.</a></p>

<p>As the bride walks down the aisle, me and Elain always look to one person: the groom. I personally know how that felt like. And I won&rsquo;t spoil it to many, but it is definitely worth the wait :) weddings are really great events, and they&rsquo;re very important ones too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;A wedding is just a ceremony, focus more on the marriage&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My wife and I had a little debate about this phrase, but she reminded me that a wedding is more than just a ceremony, <strong>it is a wedding</strong>: it is also one of God&rsquo;s ways of showing Himself to all those who witnessed it. We get reminded of His presence through the vows, through how God worked in their lives; then the wedding seems to shine brighter. The wedding in itself is a fruit, the beauty shining off of a wedding is not chained to the amount of money spent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://paolopunzalan.com/2013/10/the-wedding-vow/" target="_blank">You can have a wedding with a price tag of 2M and yet not have that key ingredient while you can have the simplest yet the most amazing because of Godâ€™s presence. - Paolo Punzalan</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Whenever God is proclaimed in any place, it&rsquo;ll shine effortlessly and it&rsquo;s beauty multiplied infinitely</strong>. Whatever flaws or physical shortcoming any wedding may have, if it is lifted up to God and offered to Him, He&rsquo;ll make it beautiful.</p>

<p>It rained that day, but that really didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
