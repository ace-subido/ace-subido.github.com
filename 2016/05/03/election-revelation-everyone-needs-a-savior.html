<p>The past few weeks had me realizing one thing: everyone needs a savior.</p>

<h2 id="israelites">Israelites</h2>

<p>If you look closely, in the Bible, the Israelites went through a bunch of phases in their history as a nation 1) where they had leaders and 2) where they didn’t have leaders.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Old Testament depicts a nation not having a leader, transitioning to having Moses and Joshua as a leader, then having a bunch of Judges, getting King Saul, King David and King Solomon</li>
  <li>Psalms sing about a relationship with God</li>
  <li>Majority of the Old Testament depicts being under rule of invaders</li>
  <li>New Testament depicts a society they all wanted a king that would release them from the Romans, instead they get Jesus</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite having a king, no king, prophets, or no prophets there was a common theme: once their hearts turned away from God it lead to ruin, shame and exile.</p>

<h2 id="better-citizens">Better citizens</h2>

<p>You see it in social media and the news across the country: the cries of change and the cries for rescue. The Filipinos and the Israelites of the Bible share a common thing: we want a savior, we want change, we want rescue, and we thought if we get a better king/president it would fix everything.</p>

<p>But it won’t.</p>

<p>Let me get straight to the point: The Philippines doesn’t need a better president. It needs better citizens. No matter how good your president is, if your heart isn’t aligned with God, then the things you value are skewed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You will objectify women</li>
  <li>You will do shortcuts (fixers, not falling in line properly, spitting on the ground, throwing trash everywhere)</li>
  <li>You will be selfish</li>
  <li>You will be easily bought</li>
  <li>You will curse your fellow man</li>
  <li>You will envy</li>
  <li>You will murder</li>
  <li>You will steal</li>
  <li>You will not respect God’s creation</li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on. The saying “change is coming” is true, but it can come tomorrow, or right now; because change should come from within you.</p>

<p>Regardless of who wins in the coming elections, the president does not hold your future, God does.</p>
