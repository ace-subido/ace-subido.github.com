  <article>
    <p>When I used to do the Daily UI challenge, I worked on a challenge where I designed a yacht chartering app:</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/napkin-app.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Before making that design, I had to do research first:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How yachts were made</li>
  <li>Where they’re primarily made</li>
  <li>How they were sold</li>
  <li>How much they cost</li>
</ul>

<p>Otherwise, the end design would look so out of touch and unconvincing.</p>

<p>As I dove deeper, I found my Youtube feed immersed with yacht related videos]. I learned how:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yacht maintenance, as a rule of thumb, usually costs ~10% of its boat value per year. So if you have a 5MUSD yacht, expect 500kUSD/year in costs.</li>
  <li>It’s a fast depreciating asset (10% p.a.).</li>
  <li>People buy yachts for fun.</li>
  <li>Italian and Turkish ship building brands are super popular.</li>
  <li>Monaco is the super yacht capital of the world.</li>
  <li>Online Yacht listings are usually outdated, so you’ll need a yacht broker to find a yacht, and a yacht surveyor (with an engineering background) to check it out if it’s good.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/YachtsForSaleCNI">Youtube has an excellent channel called “YachtsforSale” that really gets you a sneak peek of the yacht world.</a>. That same youtube channel, endorsed a website called Yatco.com. So I checked it out, and <a href="https://www.yatco.com/buy-a-yacht/detail/242458/2010-princess-yachts-motor-yacht-main-category/">I saw this 2.5MUSD yacht</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/napkin-princess-yacht.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then the <strong>useless-knowledge-hoarder</strong> in me just decided:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“hmmm, since we’ve already binged 1 hour of yacht videos. We’re already here: let’s take another 30 minutes, and do napkin math.”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I like doing “back of a napkin” math.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation">The defining characteristic of back-of-the-envelope calculations is the use of simplified assumptions. A similar phrase in the U.S. is “back of a napkin”, also used in the business world to describe sketching out a quick, rough idea of a business or product.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This may sound defeatist, but I think I will never live long enough to have money for a 2.5M USD yacht. If I ever do get the money to buy one, by some stroke of luck or genius, my conservative personality will keep me at bay from purchasing one.</p>

<p>By all means, I am not an authority on yachts, nor have I owned one, so don’t take this next image as</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business advice</li>
  <li>Some expert claim</li>
  <li>Investment advice</li>
</ul>

<p>This is just some random dude having fun with numbers. So here’s what the finances might look like, if you ever bought a 2.5M USD yacht:</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/napkin-math-yacht-plan.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Charter</strong> means to rent out your yacht to a group of people/friends/family. They’ll have a crew of 6, and they can go island/beach hopping, snorkeling, and paddleboarding, etc. Inclusive of food, drink, and accommodation. The yacht has rooms for 8 people, and 8 berths (sleeping areas).</li>
  <li>Based on the Philippine Port Authority website: to park a boat in the dock, it costs 0.020USD per GRT (internal volume, not ship weight) per day. So if our yacht has a volume of 80 tons, you can park it for 1.6USD/day.</li>
  <li>At 120 days left for personal use, that’s 4 months worth of personal vacations.</li>
  <li>You’ll get your 2.5MUSD back (break-even) in 29 years at 67% usage (33% for personal use).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you put your CapEx into bonds, you’d retain your 120M and increase it at the same rate of the yacht’s annual profit. Whereas a yacht is a depreciating asset, around 10% p.a. (5M purchase price, 4.5M the next year, 4.05M the next, and so on). So you if you sold the yacht after 10 years, it might be less than 50% of its value.</li>
  <li>You can even use your CapEx for real-estate, it will win out in the end instead of buying a yacht.</li>
  <li>Yachts are not a good investment nor a store of value. Based on the napkin math, it’s a money sink. People really buy yachts for fun and love of the sea.</li>
  <li>For people who can afford a yacht, it’s their way to do family/friends vacations, New Year’s Eve or Christmas Parties. They skip the traffic, having to pay for hotel rooms, beach/island hopping, dining-out or purchasing plane tickets. It might cost the same or a little bit more expensive than spending for a family vacation in Monaco or a cruise in the Carribeann, but for the extra price, they get privacy and exclusivity. To put this into perspective for an average person; this is a rich person’s annual travel/vacation budget. It’s their equivalent of your budget for a trip to Boracay, road trip to La Union, etc.</li>
  <li>Sample travel times: Batangas to Palawan in 7 hours. MNL to HK in 3 days.</li>
  <li>A 2.5MUSD yacht is comparable to buying a 5 bedroom home in SF (2.75MUSD in Zillow). Except that a yacht costs a lot to maintain, ~10% of its value per year. There are some cases of non-billionaire yacht owners often living in a simpler home than their yachts. They own a yacht to travel, have fun and occasionally charter out to cover costs.</li>
  <li>A 2.5MUSD yacht has more utility than a Bugatti Chiron sports car (2.75MUSD) or a Mercedes-AMG One (2.5MUSD).</li>
  <li>If you’re really into it to for the business you could buy a Sail-type yacht. The capex and fuel costs will definitely be cheaper.</li>
  <li>In the PH, you can also have locally-made yachts that might be a fraction of what it costs to purchase an Azimut, Sunseeker or AB motor-based yacht.</li>
  <li>Manny Pacquiao’s 2011 Yacht costed P25M. Willie Revillame has 2 yachts in Subic. Gretchen Barretto also has 2 yachts. Chavit Singson’s P600M super yacht was used to transport Miss World candidates for island-hopping.</li>
