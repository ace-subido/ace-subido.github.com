    <p>When I used to do the Daily UI challenge, I worked on a challenge where I designed a yacht chartering app:</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/napkin-app.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Before making that design, I had to do research first:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How yachts were made</li>
  <li>How they were sold</li>
  <li>How much they cost</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Otherwise, the end design would look so out of touch and unconvincing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.yatco.com/buy-a-yacht/detail/242458/2010-princess-yachts-motor-yacht-main-category/">As I dove deeper, I found my Youtube feed immersed with yacht related videos. I saw this 2.5MUSD yacht</a></p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/napkin-princess-yacht.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then the <strong>useless-knowledge-hoarder</strong> in me just decided:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“hmmm, since we’ve already binged 30 minutes of yacht videos, we’re already here: let’s take another 30 minutes, and do napkin math”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I like doing “back of a napkin” math.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation">The defining characteristic of back-of-the-envelope calculations is the use of simplified assumptions. A similar phrase in the U.S. is “back of a napkin”, also used in the business world to describe sketching out a quick, rough idea of a business or product.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This may sound defeatist; but I will never live to have enough net worth to buy a 2.5M USD yacht. If I ever do get the money to buy one by some stroke of luck or genius; my conservative personality will keep me at bay from purchasing one.</p>

<p>By all means, I am not an authority on yachts, nor have I owned one, so don’t take this next image as</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business advice</li>
  <li>Some expert claim</li>
  <li>Investment advice</li>
</ul>

<p>This is just some guys, having fun with numbers. So here’s what the finances might look like, if you ever bought a 2.5M USD yacht:</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/napkin-math-yacht-plan.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Charter</em> means to rent out your yacht to a group of people/friends/family. They’ll have a crew of 6, and they can go island/beach hopping, snorkeling and paddle boardin, etc. Inclusive of food, drink and accomodation. The yacht has rooms for 8 people, and 8 berths (sleeping areas)</li>
  <li>You’ll break even in 29 years at 67% usage (33% for personal use)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you put your CapEx into bonds, you’d retain your 120M and increase it at the same rate of the yacht’s annual profit. Whereas a yacht is a depreciating asset, around 10% p.a. (5M purchase price, 4.5M the next year, 4.05M the next, and so on). So you if you sold it after 10 years, it might be less than 50% of its value. You can even use your CapEx for real-estate and you’d definitely win out in the end instead of buying a yacht.</li>
  <li>Yachts are not a good investment nor a store of value. Based on the napkin math, it’s a money sink. People buy yachts because of passion and for fun.</li>
  <li>For people who can afford a yacht, it’s their way to do family/friends vacations (New Years Eve or Christmas Parties) without having to pay for hotel rooms, beach/island hopping, dining-out or purchasing plane tickets. It might cost the same or a little bit more expensive, but for the extra price: you get the privacy and exclusivity.</li>
  <li>To put into perspective for an average person: this is a rich person’s annual travel/vacation budget (trip to Boracay, road trip to Batangas, etc.). At 120 days left for personal use, that’s 4 months worth of personal vacations.</li>
  <li>Sample travel times: Batangas to Palawan in 7 hours. MNL to HK in 3 days.</li>
  <li>A 2.5MUSD yacht is comparable to buying a 5 bedroom home in SF (2.75MUSD in Zillow). Except that a yacht costs a lot to maintain, 10% of it’s value per year. Some people who likes yachts (that are not billionaires) often live in a simple home, and own a yacht to travel, charter and have fun.</li>
  <li>In contrast, a 2.5MUSD yacht is more useful than a Bugatti Chiron (2.75MUSD) or a Speedtail McLaren (2.1MUSD).</li>
  <li>If you’re really into it to for the business, to make capex annd costs cheaper you could buy a Sail-type yacht. Little fuel expenses and Sail-type yachts are also cheaper than motor-based yachts.</li>
  <li>In the PH, you can also have locally-made yachts that might be a fraction of what it costs to purchase an Azimut, Sunseeker or AB motor yacht.</li>
  <li>Manny Pacquiao’s 2011 Yacht costed P25M.</li>
