Without going into nitty grittydetails, here's a brief description of how this works:</p><h3 id="planning">Planning</h3><p>First, we have a discussion on the 1) vision and ideas behind your project, and 2)your target users. This is important, because I value what you value, and I value whatyour users need from your product.</p><p>Then, we run a requirements gathering phase just to fill up the Product Backlog for your alpha version.Afterwhich, we proceed to run the sprints. A sprint is a timeboxed effort to work on a set of features,the duration is a week. At the start of each sprint we plan for these set of features based on the Product Backlog.</p><p>The Product Backlog is the contract. I believe that priorities change as time goes, so smaller increments of yourproduct out there means you get to move faster and adjust your business strategy accordingly.This methodology is highly contrasting from some consultants/freelancers, where they just give you a ballpark estimate,you pay thousands and you find out 6 months in that your app idea didn't hit the mark. Large, vague estimates removesyou from being part of the journey that lets you find out what part of the product strategy would work and wouldn't work.</p><h3 id="active-development">Active Development</h3><p>Everyday, we engage in daily calls or standups, typically in the morning or in the evening.We can do weekly instead if it's too tedious. We open up Trello or Pivotal Tracker, our task trackerto see what has been done and what’s next in the pipeline. At the end of each sprint you get a workingversion of your product released live, or depending on the product release cycles that was agreed upon.</p><p>After a sprint finishes, we go back and do a retrospective, then take on another sprint until your alphaversion is finished. This ensures working software over comprehensive documentation, you see yourproject progress as each day goes along. You have direct access to the source code of your productvia Github or Bitbucket, based on your preference. You have a working version of your software bythe end of each sprint.</p></div></div><div class="page-block"><div class="page-block-container"><h2 id="project-engagement-process">Project Engagement Process</h2><p>I’m a developer, I want to design and develop software.

The overall process looks like this:</p><h3 id="contact">Contact</h3><ul>  <li>Someone contacts me</li>  <li>I get to understand a little detail of the project/product in mind before the meeting starts</li></ul><h3 id="planning">Planning</h3><ul>  <li>Understanding vision for the product/solution and current pain points the product is solving.</li>  <li>Agree to the outcomes we're trying to achieve (write feature lists and initial wireframes).</li>  <li>Estimate the iterations.</li>  <li>Schedule when to work on the iterations.</li></ul><h3 id="active-development-and-commercials">Active Development and Commercials</h3><ul>  <li>Signing the contract</li>  <li>50% Payment for the first iteration or to keep things going you can just pay for all the iterations</li>  <li>Start working on the iteration</li>  <li>50% Payment on delivery of the first iteration</li></ul></div></div><div class="page-block -red-block"><div class="page-block-container"><h2 id="typical-project-engagements">Typical Project Engagements</h2><p>Just so you'd have an idea, these are the typical project engagements I get into:</p><h3 id="road-to-alpha-weekly-rate">Road to Alpha (Weekly Rate)</h3><p>Typically we spend the first week planning, discussing and making wireframes. Then weestimate iterations/sprints based on this. Each iteration gets you working software.By the end of the iterations, you’ll have your minimum viable product based on the backlog.</p><h3 id="maintenance-and-support-retainer-monthly-rate">Maintenance and Support (Retainer, Monthly Rate)</h3><p>This is for you if you have a current product that's doing great, and you need someoneto maintain and build new features to keep it growing while you look for a permanent team.</p></div></div><div class="page-block"><div class="page-block-container text-center"><h3 id="hopefully-this-is-enough-helpful-information-to-get-your-interest">Hopefully, this is enough helpful information to get your interest.</h3><h3 id="so-lets-get-started">So, let's get started?</h3><a class="button" href="mailto:hello@acesubido.com">Contact Me</a></div></div>
