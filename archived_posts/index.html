        <p>It’s been 8 months since I started working from home. I’m with a company called Bloom Solutions, it’s a fintech startup based in the Philippines. Everyone works remotely, we meet face-to-face once or every other a week. Sometimes a few people meet up together on a coffee shop if some work needs to be tightly done together. Other than that, under normal circumstances, most of the work being punched out is done at home.</p>

        <p>This week I encountered some features that I engineered which broke in production, it kept me on my toes, but it was worth it to ship the feature properly. A little collection of things I noted down:</p>

        <p>So, I’m in the process of trying to get the best performance out of our internet setup at home. I’ve worked with Network Architects and ansible’d network configurations for large Hadoop clusters that transfer terabytes, but sadly, I haven’t sat down and fixed our internet at home. I’m a software engineer, and no means a hardcore Cisco Certified Network Engineer, so I decided to sit on this problem and try to improve our situation.</p>

        <p>I frequently work with a large ruby application, and whenever I run <code class="highlighter-rouge">rspec path/to/single_unit_test.rb</code> in a Rails application, it takes 2-3 seconds before the test starts. This is because of the amount of source files that are involved in the application. Fortunately, Shopify released a gem called <a href="https://github.com/shopify/bootsnap"><code class="highlighter-rouge">bootsnap</code></a>.</p>

        <p>There are countless blog posts and stack overflow explanations about this, figured I need to write this little note for myself. To start things off, check this example of computing PHPKRW using hypothetical gold as a go-between:</p>

        <p><em>A little note:</em> Developers are craftsmen. They build things for a living. As a side effect, they’ll try to build a lot of things that they need or want for themselves. A handful, to an extent, dreams to run a business around what they’ve built. Most fail, not because they didn’t have enough time or it didn’t have enough features (trust me, we can build a lot of unwanted features). The main reason most fail is no one knows about the things they’ve built in the first place, and no one uses them, even themselves.</p>

        <p>I get that question from some of my officemates. How can people appreciate “Big Data Technologies”. Is there a demo to make people appreciate “Big Data” or “Hadoop”? How can we sell “Data Lakes vs Data Warehouses”.</p>

        <p>It’s been a few weeks/months since I’ve been plunged into this “Big Data” ecosystem, all I could sense was that
“Big Data” is a marketing term for problems that require “Distributed Frameworks” as solutions, much like how “Cloud” is a marketing term for how “Remote Servers” are provisioned.</p>
