> For one, I could think of Big Data/Hadoop. In the past one year, at least ten "coaching institutes" have sprang up in the area I live (in Bangalore) claiming to teach Hadoop and promising high paying jobs. I went in there for a "demo session", and they are like "you can learn Hadoop and get a high paying job with absolutely no programming experience".
Anyway, these places always get some kind of gullible people.
I think this is a fad, and it will die down soon. What do you think about this? Do you think there are any other fads like this ? I think this is a fad, and it will die down soon. What do you think about this?

The "Big Data" term is definitely a fad. I think of "Big Data" as marketing for "distributed computing and storage", much like how "Cloud" is a marketing term for "provisioning remote servers with applications".

On "Big Data" as a fad, certain companies get interested when you tell them that you can store, deal and analyse x00 TB's amount of stuff without constantly/annually investing 6-8 dollar figures into HP/Dell/Oracle/SAP hardware/licenses/software/support.

It's a fresh change when your "business analysts" (non-programming Excel and SQL power users) can offload large ETL SQL scripts moving X00 GB's daily on an open-source framework like Hadoop, and you only need to purchase a "technical support and training package" with companies like Hortonworks and Cloudera.

And no, they won't be getting any talented programmers or data scientists who would instantly leverage Pandas or python libraries because currently all the talent would be drained out to startups and high-tech companies. The only staff they have is what they have and they should work with them instead of seeking out other people.

So, no, "distributed computing and storage" isn't a fad, and for the next 5-15 years, companies will need people working on their "Big Data" things.

Disclaimer: I've worked with Hadoop POC's and deployments with Telco's, Power Distribution Companies and Banks.
