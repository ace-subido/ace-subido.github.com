So for the last 2 years I've only read 2 books that I found very helpful. These 2 books revolved around building businesses and management from the perspective of

Rework is one of the more opinionated and interesting books I've read

# Zero To One by Peter Thiel

This book gave me a higher perspective in technology overall.

# Thinking Fast and Slow
