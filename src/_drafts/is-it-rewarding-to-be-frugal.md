title: Is it rewarding to be frugal?
---
Someone asked this in /r/phinvest:

> For people who practiced delaying their gratification during their early 20s....
> Magkuripot,
> Magipon ng magipon while investing with the intention of growing money exponentially,
> Iwas travel,
> Iwas mall,
> Live in a very frugal manner in every aspect without sacrificing their health and well-being,
> How did it turn out for you? Rewarding ba talaga? Did you regret doing it? Or is it just the right way for people na gusto talagang yumaman at magbuild ng wealth that lasts a lifetime or even generations to come?
> One more thing... How do you reward yourself while you're on the process of delaying gratification?

Me and my wife are in our early 30's. Frugality is very rewarding for us, it has allowed us to live a comfortable life not because of the actual money. It's made us comfortable because it has allowed us to be content and sharp. Content with our homemade coffee and budget android phones.

If there's one thing we never regretted spending on: it's travel. Kahit simpleng beach trip papi. We aimed to always spare some budget for 1 flight or 1 road trip every year.

We've always heard this advice from our wedding ninongs/ninangs: when your kids grow up they don't tell their classmates if they lived in a big house in Forbes or rented a small apartment in Bicutan. Your kids will always be excited to talk about the times your family went to a roadtrip or traveled to another country.

Sure we could have an additional +400KPHP net worth if we didn't travel every single year for 8 years, but those travel memories are considered as "wealth that lasts a lifetime or even generations to come". 

From a simple roadtrip to the beach to a flight to Japan. It's not the expensive restaurants, the hotels or the malling: travel is what you'll talk about 30 years from now around the dinner table during Christmas. Even with your closest friends and especially with your kids.
