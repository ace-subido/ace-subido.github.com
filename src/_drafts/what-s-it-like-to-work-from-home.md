title: What's it like to work from home\?
---

Recently I started working from home, it's been 1 1/2 months since I started. I'm with a company called Bloom Solutions, it's a fintech startup based in the Philippines. Everyone works remotely, although we meet once or twice a week, most of the work being punched out is done at home.

A lot of people look down on this type of setup, I guess it's mostly "change". People are naturally afraid of "new things", because they don't have a current benchmark of success on whatever that new thing was.

"Working from home" certainly has it's perks:

- Saves time - this is the biggest perk ever. No more 1 1/2 hour one-way commutes, it saves me 3 hours of being on the road. If I roughly compute it, that's 15 hours a week spent on the road. Which is 60 hours a month, equivalent to 2.5 days a month. If you compute that over a year, it's equivalent to 30 days being the road. A month where I could've spent it somewhere else. I now spend more time with my newborn, help out my wife around the house and time for other things.
- Saves money - Eat at home. No parking expense. No gas expense. No "lunch money" expense.
- Physical Location not a problem - I sync timezones and schedules with the team when I go out of the country.
- Flexible schedule - As long as I sync with the team, I can do errands and still put out the work needed. Gone are the days that you'll have to take a leave to get your VISA.
- Real Results-Oriented - Work from home naturally leaves little place for a business to become a "body shop" business, where "number of hours being inside the office" slowly becomes the metric to measure productivity. You'll find that you finish more work, and you get to measure your productivity in a more concrete manner with this setup. "Work from home" forces you to produce tangible value instead of just waiting for 5pm to arrive.
- Productive meetings - the meetings revolve around strategy, architectural-level and design decisions. No 1-hour meeting just discussing status updates or doing follow ups.

Though it certainly has it's downfalls:

- Blurring Lines - the first few weeks, you wouldn't know that it's already at the weekend. Life and Work are blurred together. I try to place some distance between them. Before I face my laptop, I take a bath, brush my teeth, wear something else aside from my PJ's, have my breakfast and then "go" to work. Which involves me going a place in the house where my "office chair" (I bought one at Lazada, it's good) and "table" resides.
- Personal Rhythm - it helps you maintain discipline, focus and being systematic with how your spend your time. I open my personal time tracker (I use Harvest) and keep track of time. This rhythm gets me going.
- Wife and Children - you love them, too much that it's hard not to ignore them. They know they shouldn't bother you, so they don't, but really, they're there. It's hard not to talk to Elain or play with Navi during my 5 minute pomodoro breaks or when a Docker image is building for 13 minutes in the CI.
- Friends and Relatives - When friends and relatives are over for lunch, this is how it usually goes when my wife mentions to them I work from home: "Oh! He works from home? That sounds great! Hey Ace, how's working from home?". "Umm, it's great!". As much as I want not to offend you, please let me focus. When you're at the office, office chit-chat breaks you off your rhythm. This applies even at people working from home, the difference is: the people around you aren't working. Your lack of interactivity would sometimes come across wrongly to relatives and friends. You might have to explain things to them that just because you're in your PJ's, that doesn't mean you're not punching out real work.

I'll probably update this post as time goes by, it's certainly a life-changing on-going experience.
