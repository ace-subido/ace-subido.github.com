title: Getting into budgeting!
---

Recently I got to push myself to actually purchase a YNAB subscription, its 50USD a year, and so far it's been really worth it. This post won't be about how great YNAB is (but, really, it's been really useful) but it's more of a personal post on the journey of how me and Elain "try" to handle our finances.

Making money is a big focus for me. As a breadwinner it's something I try to think of very often, but getting an idea of where the money goes is another thing on it's own. Usually, using personal accounting software solves that. Though these things tell me where the money went to, but that doesn't solve taking control of how money is being spent, and that's where budgets come in. 

In a single phrase: budgeting is all about creating a plan on how you will spend your money.

During the course of our marriage we just tried to get a handle of our finances. Me and Elain have tried budgeting using the following "techniques":

- Custom Excel Sheets, where we do monthly check ups between
- Free iPad Apps
- Envelope System
- Bank Accounts acting as "Envelopes" for the Envelope System
- and a ton of others

> So what makes YNAB different?

For me and Elain it's:

1. The "simple envelope" system, in steroids.
2. Super straightforward to use, syncs with a mobile device.
3. I guess, it's more than just another accounting software. The software is accompanied by a lot of guides and tutorials on how to actually create a proper budget, even actually getting your spouse to have regular "budget meetings".
