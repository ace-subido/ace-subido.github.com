title: Getting into budgeting!
---

Recently I got to push myself to actually purchase a YNAB subscription, its 50USD a year, and so far it's been really worth it. This post won't be about how great YNAB is (but, really, it's been really useful) but it's more of a personal post on the journey of how me and Elain "try" to handle our finances.

Making money is a big focus for me. As a breadwinner it's something I try to think of very often, but getting an idea of where the money goes is another thing on it's own. Usually, using a personal accounting software solves that, but that doesn't solve taking control of how money is spent, and that's where budgets come in. 

In a single phrase: budgeting is all about knowing how much you will spend on something that's important to you.

### Other Personal Accounting Software

Me and Elain have tried budgeting using the following "techniques":

- Custom Excel Sheets
- Free iPad Apps
- Envelope System
- Bank Accounts acting as "Envelopes" for the Envelope System
- and a ton of others

> So what makes YNAB different?

For me and Elain it's:

1. The "simple envelope" system, in steroids.
2. Super simple to use, syncs with a mobile device
3. I guess, it's more than just another accounting software. The software is accompanied by a lot of guides and tutorials on how to actually create a proper budget, even actually getting your spouse to have regular "budget meetings".
