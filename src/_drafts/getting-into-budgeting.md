title: Handling Household Expenses

For the past 6 months I've been using YNAB

### Where do budgets come in?
There are 3 aspects about handling our finances that me and Elain have noted down for ourselves:

1. Making Money
2. Knowing where the money goes to
3. Controlling the amount where the money goes to

As a breadwinner, #1 is my biggest focus, it's something I try to think of very often, but it shouldn't make me forget about #2 and more importantly #3. There's a general flow in our married life that if we make more money, we subconsciously lean to spending or earmarking it more. Earmarking meaning, it's not going to be liquid anymore (investments, premiums, mortgage, etc.). More money leads to more debt/asset, more debt/asset leads to more stress. 

"Why would there be more stress with more assets?"

"Cost of money" is generally another topic. Investments are also costly, you'd have to weigh-in loss of opportunity when you're earmarking some form of capital into something unforseen. That's why every financial advisor worth listening to makes sure you do 3 things before putting money into investments: 

1. Erase all loans and debts
2. Ensure you are "liquid" and have enough cash to cover 6 months worth of your monthly expenses
3. Have health insurance to cover any medical emergency

In a single phrase: budgeting is all about creating a plan on how you will spend your money.

### Systems vs Software


During the course of our marriage we tried to get a handle of our finances. Me and Elain have tried budgeting using the following "techniques":

- Custom Excel Sheets, where we do monthly check ups between - didn't work, too far inbetween
- Relied on Banking Accounts to tell us where the money went - wasn't too granular, it just showed withdrawals
- Using Free iPad Apps
- Envelope System, literally envelopes with cash
- Bank Accounts acting as "Envelopes" for the Envelope System
- and a ton of others

> So what makes YNAB different?

For me and Elain it's:

1. The "simple envelope" system, in steroids.
2. Super straightforward to use, syncs with a mobile device.
3. I guess, it's more than just another accounting software. The software is accompanied by a lot of guides and tutorials on how to actually create a proper budget, even actually getting your spouse to have regular "budget meetings".
