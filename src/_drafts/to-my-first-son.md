title: To my first son, Navi
---

When your mom was in labor she told me to write a letter to you. It's been 2 months, and now I finally had a sliver of time to write this. I guess there's a lot that a parent can say. A lifetime of stories. A single post won't do, maybe I'll just described the feelings that came over me during the course of time.

When we learned we were pregnant with you, that was called "Happiness". The initial OB that we went too suggested you might not "exist". Anxiously we went to a clinic to check with an ultrasound machine.

But, we saw you. You were in that ultrasound screen. I didn't imagine that looking at a fluttering little dot on the screen would be one of the happiest moments in my life.
