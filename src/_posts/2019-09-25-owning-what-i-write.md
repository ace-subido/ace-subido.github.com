I've been writing on different platforms for most of my online life. I've blogged on:

- Livejournal
- Multiply
- Tumblr
- Blogger / Blogspot
- Wordpress

and the latest is Medium.

Lately, I've been thinking: "what if Medium also goes down, or stops being relevant?" Then I thought, maybe it's just time for me to own my content. For starters, I'll just start writing back here and keep my Medium.com inactive. That's the first thing I'll be doing.

I've mulled around the idea of paying for blog hosting, like svbtle or posthaven to ensure that it stays online. I think I'll just opt for this git repo for now.
