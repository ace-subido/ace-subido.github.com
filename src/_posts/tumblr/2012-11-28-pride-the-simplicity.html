<h4>Deceitful forms</h4>

<p>Most people attribute pride as to those who have strong-personalities: people who rub off wrongly to them. That&rsquo;s one of the tricks the devil uses, but little do we know that pride can manifest itself in the simplest of forms:</p>

<ul><li>You don&rsquo;t need to consult other people with matters of life because you&rsquo;re &ldquo;okay&rdquo;, actually you don&rsquo;t want to talk about it because it&rsquo;s not that important and you &ldquo;know&rdquo; things already.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t &ldquo;ask&rdquo; God for anything because you&rsquo;re already &ldquo;fine&rdquo;. You like to give Him passing-by remarks during prayers like saying &ldquo;thanks&rdquo;, but don&rsquo;t actually mean it.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t like telling your issues to people you are accountable with. 
Deep inside, it feels embarrassing. I mean come on you&rsquo;re a grown up now, I mean come on you&rsquo;ve been a Christian for more than a decade, it&rsquo;s quite shameful to tell other people you still have issues. You can &ldquo;figure&rdquo; it out on your own.</li>
</ul><p>As time passes by in our 20&rsquo;s, 30&rsquo;s, 40&rsquo;s and other decades, God constantly let&rsquo;s us realize that life&rsquo;s too short to have time for pride. Forget saving face, learn as much as you can. It&rsquo;s up to us, to let Him open our eyes on this:</p>

<p><em>Be absolutely hungry, stay foolish.</em></p>

<p>Which begs the question to check ourselves: Are we hungry for God? Or are we full and comfortable, enough to say we&rsquo;re actually not hungry for Him anymore?</p>
