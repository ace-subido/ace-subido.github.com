<p><strong>Under construction</strong></p>



<p>Getting back into writing with a renewed focus. I&rsquo;m giving my blog a fresh new restart from theperiva.tumblr.com (though I won&rsquo;t retire that blog, it&rsquo;ll be archived). theperiva was a bit random, it was literally a notepad of scribbles from me. This site will be a reboot of that, I&rsquo;ll be focusing more on this being a journal rather than a repository of random finds :)</p>



<p><strong>Why tumblr?</strong></p>



<p>Tumblr is the nearest next thing to the most stripped down blogging engine I know. It has no army of settings to tinker with, or a plethora of css files to deal with. It simply allows me to have this quiet blue space to write, just to concentrate on producing content.</p>



<p>Hopefully this&rsquo;ll be finished before the weekend. Excited to write about a lot of things in this space of mine!</p>
