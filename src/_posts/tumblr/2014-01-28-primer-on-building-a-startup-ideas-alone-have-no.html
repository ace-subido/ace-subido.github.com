<p>Imagine the most beautiful portrait or landscape you can think of. Got it? Okay hold it there &ndash;</p>

<p>Now go ahead and paint it.</p>

<p>Everyone has ideas, if you&rsquo;ve thought of some special idea, chances are, someone already thought of it before you and they&rsquo;re already 3 steps ahead. It&rsquo;s a well known fact in the tech industry: the value of execution is much higher than the idea behind it.</p>

<p>Think of how many people thought of an online bookstore back in the 90&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;ll come to wonder why Amazon was the only one who got it right.</p>
