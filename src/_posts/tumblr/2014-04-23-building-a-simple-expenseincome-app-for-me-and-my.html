<p>I&rsquo;m working on a simple expense/income tracker that me and my wife can use. Excel sheets/templates and other finance apps are way too complicated, we both agreed that in the end accounting is as simple as taking down notes in a ledger &ndash; why not enter those entries just as easy as tweeting (categorize expense/income in hashtags, etc.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as complex or innovative as other accounting systems and projects, but it&rsquo;s working out for the both of us and we&rsquo;re using it. It&rsquo;s also a nice excuse of a project for me to flex out Ruby code.</p>
