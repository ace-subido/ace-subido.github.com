title: When you are catching your last few breaths in your death bed, the ones who
  will be around you will not be your golfing buddies. They will be there an hour,
  maybe 2. It will not be your officemates nor your high school friends. It will be
  your spouse who has stayed with you all these decades. It will be your children
  who have been your source of joy for years. It will be your family who will be holding
  your hand in those last few moments on earth. With this in mind, guess who you should
  be investing your most precious moments with?
