<p>I haven&rsquo;t been totally honest on my reasons for having sleepless nights.</p>



<ul><li>No, I wasn&rsquo;t on Facebook, and no I wasn&rsquo;t surfing HackerNews, TechCrunch or Twitter. </li>
<li>No, I haven&rsquo;t updated my github projects. </li>
<li>Yes, there may be nights I get home late because I love visiting or driving my girlfriend to her QC home. </li>
</ul><p>But mostly, I was playing around with a Javascript stack that I&rsquo;ve been dying to try out for the past 2 weeks.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve been focusing on javascript and CSS for the past few months. Really, just to get my game up on front-end technologies. I&rsquo;ll be posting updates on what I&rsquo;ll be playing with in the next few months. I&rsquo;m excited as I can be. </p>
