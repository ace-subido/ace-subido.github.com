<p>A friend posted this as his status over Facebook. I won&rsquo;t answer it but it did spark some interesting thoughts over preparing dinner with Elain.</p>

<p>Success has an absolute definition:</p>

<ul><li>the correct or desired result of an attempt (Merriam-Webster)</li>
<li>favorable or desired outcome (Merriam-Webster)</li>
<li>;also: the attainment of wealth, favor, or eminence (Merriam-Webster)</li>
<li>the accomplishment of an aim or purpose (Oxford)</li>
<li><strong>Success</strong> comes from the latin word <em>successus</em>: to advance, to climb </li>
</ul><p><strong>Success and Desires</strong></p>

<p>Success mainly deals with a &lsquo;desired result&rsquo; &ndash; in short, it goes around the concept of achieving a 'desire&rsquo;. A specific 'desire&rsquo; has 'value&rsquo;. Merriam-Webster and most of the world couples the word 'success&rsquo; with money, power, control and fame; obviously stems from the fact that everyone desires and values those 4 things above all else.</p>

<p>It is kind of self-centered; success is about us getting goals, it is about achieving what you value.</p>

<p>Weird thing is most of the time we may already have succeeded in achieving our goals, but the problem is we value something else, that&rsquo;s why sometimes we feel like a failure. The world has tricked us into buying things we don&rsquo;t need, achieving certain positions and behaving in a certain way to be 'valuable&rsquo; just because the 'world says so&rsquo;. The funny thing is: we envy, and there are times we never get contented.</p>

<p>Be very careful with 'success&rsquo;, because we might be succeeding in things that are apparently not valuable after all.</p>

<p>So.. at 30, what do <strong>you</strong> value?</p>
