<p>Last week I tackled on making a <a href="http://acesubido.com/2013/11/17/10-weekend-ui-challenge.html" target="_blank">login page on top of Bootstrap</a>, this week I tried to do something from scratch, only depending on jQuery. This week I&rsquo;ll try doing modals, specifically the Windows 8 Metro Modal.</p>

<p><strong>The Windows 8 Modal</strong></p>

<p><em><a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/2c7b290a-dd84-44a7-b3f4-29abc55fe010/how-to-show-dialog-with-textbox-control?forum=winappswithcsharp" target="_blank">Photo credits</a></em></p>

<p>Basically a modal is a child interface that requires the users to interact with it before they can go back to the main application as part of a specfic workflow.</p>

<p>The Windows 8 Modal has this distinct design that can been seen with Microsoft products that are adapting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)" target="_blank">Metro/Microsoft-Modern Design pattern</a>. For one, it horizontally takes up the full-width of the viewport and is vertically centered as well.</p>

<p>Honestly, I could have gotten a random modal library and skinned it to look like the Windows 8 Modal, but I wanted to get my hands refreshed on CSS/JS fundamentals. So I built the modal from scratch.</p>

<p>You can see the project in <a href="http://ace-subido.github.io/windows8-metro-modal/" target="_blank">Github</a>. You can even download it and use it in your projects.</p>

<p>This small project refreshed some of my front-end fundamentals and I actually had fun doing this one from scratch:</p>

<ul><li>Binding and Unbinding of events by jQuery</li>
<li>How to vertically and horizontally center a div using CSS Transforms</li>
<li>Learned deeply about transitions</li>
<li>Created a SASS mixin that does a button css reset. Which is really handy for making custom-made buttons.</li>
</ul><p>8 more weeks to go!</p>
