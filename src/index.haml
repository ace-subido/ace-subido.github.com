      # Hi, my name is Ace Subido ðŸ‘‹

      ### I make software. I currently work at [Bloom Solutions](https://bloom.solutions) as a Software Engineer. I like writing and contributing open source software on [Github](https://github.com/ace-subido). I do this because I know it helps a lot of people in building things.

      ### I like writing about software development at [Medium](https://medium.com/@acesubido). Aside from writing about software development, I like to write about my experiences, certain world views, life lessons and events that would be helpful to my children, and to my future self.

      _keeping this short, I really find it awkward to write a 1st-person bio_ ðŸ˜¶
