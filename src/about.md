Just keeping this short (since I really find it awkward to write a bio of myself)

- I'm a christian. This is who I am. I am a husband to a wonderful woman named [Elain Ojeda-Subido](http://elainojeda.com)
- I make software. This is what I do. Engineer, Senior Developer, Research and Development Manager, Senior Product Engineer, UX Designer, Technepreneur; all of those are just titles for some specific thing I once did, or am still doing. I currently work at [Amihan](http://agsx.net) as a Director for Product Engineering for their Big Data & Analytics Practice
- I contribute to and create open-source projects that try to make this world a little better. I build things that help people in their work, and I've done a few exercises and experiments on the side. Some of my work are: [CSS Microsoft Modern Buttons](https://github.com/ace-subido/css3-microsoft-metro-buttons), [spaced-out](https://github.com/ace-subido/spaced-out), [Pouchnote](http://github.com/ace-subido/pouchnote), and [aclys](https://github.com/ace-subido/aclys).
- Other UI experiments reside in my [Codepen](https://codepen.io/ace-subido) account.

I am on [Github](https://github.com/ace-subido) and [Codepen](https://codepen.io/ace-subido). You can reach me at hello@acesubido.com
