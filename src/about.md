Just keeping this short since I really find it awkward to write a bio of myself:

- I'm a christian. This is who I am. I am a husband to a wonderful woman named [Elain](http://elainojeda.com) and a father to my first baby, Samuel Navi.
- I make software. This is what I do. I currently work at [Bloom Solutions](https://bloom.solutions) as a Software Engineer.
- I contribute to and create open-source projects that try to make this world a little better. I am on [Github](https://github.com/ace-subido) and [Codepen](https://codepen.io/ace-subido).
- You can reach me at hello@acesubido.com
