title: Election Thought: Everyone needs a Savior
---

The past few weeks had me realizing one thing: everyone needs a savior.

## Israelites

If you look closely, in the Bible, the Israelites went through a bunch of phases in their history as a nation 1) where they had leaders and 2) where they didn't have leaders.

- Old Testament depicts a nation not having a leader, transitioning to having Moses and Joshua as a leader, then having a bunch of Judges, getting King Saul, King David and King Solomon
- Psalms sing about a relationship with God
- Majority of the Old Testament depicts being under rule of invaders
- New Testament depicts a society they all wanted a king that would release them from the Romans, instead they get Jesus

Despite having a king, no king, prophets, or no prophets there was a common theme: once their hearts turned away from God it lead to ruin, shame and exile.

## Better citizens

You see it in social media and the news across the country: the cries of change and the cries for rescue. The Filipinos and the Israelites of the Bible share a common thing: we want a savior, we want change, we want rescue, and we thought if we get a better king/president it would fix everything.

But it won't.

Let me get straight to the point: The Philippines doesn't need a better president. It needs better citizens. No matter how good your president is, if your heart isn't aligned with God, then the things you value are skewed.

- You will objectify women
- You will do shortcuts (fixers, not falling in line properly, spitting on the ground, throwing trash everywhere)
- You will be selfish
- You will be easily bought
- You will curse your fellow man
- You will envy
- You will murder
- You will steal
- You will not respect God's creation

The list goes on. The saying "change is coming" is true, but it can come tomorrow, or right now; because change should come from within you.

Regardless of who wins in the coming elections, the president does not hold your future, God does.
