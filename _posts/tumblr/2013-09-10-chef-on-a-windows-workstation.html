<p>Setting up an admin workstation for Chef on Windows might be a little daunting for people starting out on Chef and for those who are not comfortable with the command line. This snippet is a useful little batch file we use at work.</p>

<p>First, install the Omnibus Installer for Chef-Client then create a batch file with this script:</p>

<pre><code>@echo off

set PATH=C:\opscode\chef\embedded\bin;C:\opscode\chef\bin;C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0;

cmd
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a command prompt with a clean PATH that only contains <em>knife</em>, <em>gem</em> and other goodies.</p>

<p>Another heads up: When doing <em>knife configure -i</em> for the first time on Windows, you&rsquo;ll be asked for file paths on your admin.pem and other stuff. Use double back-slashes instead of a normal slash</p>
