<p>In my line of work, I do not see it as work. I grew to have a heart for it. In my professional life I code, I attend meetings, I design, I write and the list goes on. I absolutely immerse myself in something I really enjoy doing, and it is something I see massive value in.</p>

<p>However a few days ago, I got sick. I actually slept for most of the day, I called my fiance and laughed out on our random phone calls. I had great conversations with my parents. Goofed around with my brother. I played some computer games. I watched movies. I called up some friends and laughed a lot.</p>

<p>I stopped thinking about my professional life for a single day. No hackernews, no github surfing, and no writing down little notes and coding thoughts on my notebook.</p>

<p>It reminded me how valuable stopping is to my life. It changes things, shifts perspectives, it allows you to zoom out for a while. It reminded me of the more valuable things in life.</p>

<p>Christianity is all about relationships. The entire bible is centered around the idea of God wanting to build this grand relationship with you. The greatest commandments are to love one another. To actually, purposely, with intent, decide on building relationships. No one sets out to be the richest man in the cemetery, because it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you built this or that. What matters in the end are those who saw real value in spending and sharing their lives with you, that they felt God&rsquo;s love flow through you.</p>

<p>So try stopping for a bit today, and think: what is really valuable in your life?</p>
