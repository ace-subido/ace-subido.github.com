<p>Ever faced a codebase that had it&rsquo;s last commit some years ago?</p>

<p>Either you have a bug to fix or a new feature that was asked implement, you will open up that text-editor/IDE and face off with old code. Right off the bat, it looks pretty &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;, even if you yourself wrote it. The only exceptional pieces of &ldquo;old code&rdquo; are parts you <strong>never</strong> have to open, because <strong>1)</strong> they&rsquo;re working exactly the way people need it to work and <strong>2)</strong> users don&rsquo;t ask for anything more than that.</p>

<hr><p>People write code without a clear glimpse of the future. Some people do try their best to future-proof certain parts of the code, but it&rsquo;s still written with uncertainty.</p>

<p>A few years pass and new things need to happen. Developers roll up their sleeves and see new opportunities of abstraction, new processes to pull out and modularize.</p>

<p>The thing is, those who work on top of the old code have the advantage of looking backwards, they can write the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that can solve what really needs solving. That&rsquo;s why no matter how pretty some patches of code presently look, they will almost always look crude in the future.</p>

<p>No matter how bad it looks, nobody can really blame previous developers; unless they didn&rsquo;t have a firm grasp of the framework the software was built upon in the first place, but that&rsquo;s a totally different story.</p>

<p>Besides, in the near future, even our &ldquo;shiny new code&rdquo; will suffer the same fate.</p>
