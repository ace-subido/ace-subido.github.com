  <p>I want to propose to Elain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A thought process that I went through 3 months ago.</p>

<p><img src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc1gmsyQug1rqf6g8.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Currently, we&rsquo;re happily engaged and preparing for our wedding.</p>

<p>After buying her the engagement ring and actually proposing, some men approached me how I went on buying that ring for her. Questions rose:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you buy it?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Magkano yung ring?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Pano mo malalaman kung okay yung ring?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What are the factors of its cost?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What are things I should know about when buying a ring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortunately I was prepared to give short answers to these questions, since I took a crash course on rings by researching them all up on the net and talking to random jewelers in bridal fairs.</p>

<p>You see it&rsquo;s really important that we know what we&rsquo;re going to buy for the one we love, it&rsquo;s important to note that we are prepared to face a jeweler and we know our stuff. The responsibility of being prepared with any major purchase is essential for any man. Think about it, if you buy a car, you study everything about cars and other options before you even get the car. The same goes for buying a house.</p>

<p>Buying a ring has that same level of importance as any other major purchase.</p>

<p>So I put together this <a href="http://ace-subido.github.com/blog/engagementring/" target="_blank">simple guide</a>. It&rsquo;s pretty short, and it won&rsquo;t take you more than 3 minutes to take it all in.</p>

<p>Have fun reading!</p>
