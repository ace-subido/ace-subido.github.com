<p>There’s the timezone of the computer of the client, the timezone the user made his input into (app level), the timezone of his account settings (app level), and the timezone of your server, which hopefully is synced with the timezone of your database.</p>

<p>I’d imagine the madness future programmers would go through if they’re dealing with timezones from clients on other planets as well.</p>
