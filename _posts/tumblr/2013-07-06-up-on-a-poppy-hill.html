<p>Me and Elain with Rivelle, Jed, Jodi and Zyrus, watched Studio Ghibli&rsquo;s <em>Up On A Poppy Hill</em>. I absolutely loved the film! I really appreciated and admired the craftsmanship present into the film.</p>

<h4>The Bro-zone: a higher level than the &ldquo;Friend-zone&rdquo;</h4>

<p>One highlight while watching the film: the two main characters, &ldquo;Umi&rdquo; (girl) and &ldquo;Shun&rdquo; (boy) have fallen deeply in love with each other. Shun found out about something very disturbing and Umi was taken aback by this <em>very</em> surprising revelation that blew us all away :))</p>
