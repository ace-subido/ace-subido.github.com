<p>It&rsquo;s already November and I didn&rsquo;t realize how God has been really good: Left my old job, got married to my first-and-last girlfriend, went to Malaysia, settled down in a house, got a new job that enhanced my skills in a way I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend, shaved my head, grew a beard so long arabians thought I was arabian, experienced our first hospital check-in, ate at new places, met new people, went to Boracay, turned 26, killed a swarm of roaches, attended our first couples getaway, went to Baguio, did cycling for a few months, experienced our first tropical storm as a married couple, bought our first christmas tree and finally, I learned a lot &ndash; and this year hasn&rsquo;t ended yet :)</p>
