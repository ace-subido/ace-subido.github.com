    <p>I love the actuality of space. The thought that if you go up high enough, there&rsquo;s a vast expanse beyond the sky. Back then, as a kid, this was the cause for majority of my daydreaming.</p>

<p>I remembered the time in my high school where our teacher arranged for a stargazing session. It was an all-nighter thing with the entire science club. The only thing in my recollection; it was the first time I saw a planet right in front of my eyes. Not those planets you see in textbooks, the one rendered by artists, but a real one, as real as the pencil you have in your hand. It&rsquo;s just there, reflected on a piece of glass attached to a telescope. The thought of space is amazing, but seeing that right there before my eyes blew my 14-year old mind.</p>

<p>Another thing I also recollected: it was the PAGASA UP Observatory in Diliman.</p>

<p>One night back in 2012, I went there with my wife and 3 other friends :) Long story short, they all had fun :)</p>

<p>No more long prose, here are some details:</p>

<ul><li>Here&rsquo;s the number for that UP Observatory - 929-1237</li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com.ph/maps/@14.6509404,121.0721939,19z?hl=en" target="_blank">&hellip;and a map to where it is</a></li>
<li>&hellip;annndddd also a picture of the building (credits for the photo goes to <a href="http://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/astronomy/astronomy-in-the-philippines" target="_blank">PAGASA</a>) <img src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/b7d4d8f45eb7158b88388d467c2520f8/tumblr_inline_nfsllkRlFG1rqf6g8.jpg" alt=""/></li>
<li>Upon calling the number, ask if they can accommodate you and if the place is not busy for the night. If it&rsquo;s not busy, ask for the forecast before you go there, you don&rsquo;t want to go there all excited only to find out no planets are visible and the skies aren&rsquo;t clear. </li>
<li>Remember you can&rsquo;t book the &ldquo;viewing of the cosmos&rdquo; in advance like some special food in your favourite restaurant. You&rsquo;re just hoping that most of the things you want to see are there and the skies are clear.</li>
<li>Depending on the planets you want to see, be prepared for an all-nighter, Go there after 7pm or 8pm, prepare to stay up as late as 2am depending on the things you want to view. </li>
<li>We brought food, water, stayed in our cars, listened to music, cleaned up after ourselves and kept quiet to pay respect to the place. Noisy and rowdy people will probably get a lot of unwanted attention from the campus security.</li>
<li>You can rent their telescopes, if I recall correctly, you can rent each for below 50PHP.</li>
<li>Ask nicely, you&rsquo;ll get help from them in finding a planet. Trust me, if you haven&rsquo;t handled a telescope before, they&rsquo;re hard to find.</li>
<li>The planets are moving targets since the earth is rotating, they&rsquo;re smaller than a grain of sand compared to the entire expanse of the sky.  </li>
<li>The PAGASA staff that was helping us out even gave us a friendly challenge to find the moon. It&rsquo;s not as easy as we all thought.</li>
<li>I offered to pay them extra because seriously, the experience is worth more than 20PHP.</li>
</ul><p>Oh, and here&rsquo;s a shot of the moon from my wife&rsquo;s iPhone4s pointed directly at the viewfinder of a telescope.</p>
