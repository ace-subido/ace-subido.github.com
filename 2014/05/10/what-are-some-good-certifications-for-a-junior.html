    <blockquote>
  <p>Are there any skill-building programs or certifications out there that you could recommend to a developer at the very beginning of his (post-bootcamp) career? Something that could ideally be done in addition to a part-time or full-time job? Thank you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a lot of skill-building programs out there but you gotta ask yourself first on which &lsquo;programming world&rsquo; you would like to be part of:</p>

<p>Certifications are really good if you really want to build a career into middle-management, in-house software development departments a.k.a. mega-corp widget factories; these types highly appreciate certificates. A big pharmaceutical company would love to see a Microsoft Certificate over a Github profile since they don&rsquo;t care about the code, they just care about you passing a &ldquo;industry standard test&rdquo; so that you would fit X number of requirements and feel safe that they got the right person. Couple your certificate with a filled out LinkedIn profile; and they&rsquo;ll highly consider you.</p>

<p>Building a good Github profile/portfolio website is the better route if you want to build your career around working for companies that sell software as their core product, or well-known shops (Fog Creek, Basecamp, ThoughtBot, PivotalLabs, etc.). These type of companies highly value code and work output, and they&rsquo;d understand the value in your profile. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, a certificate would help in some way but if you can&rsquo;t show them you can code or be comfortable with the command line, they&rsquo;ll go for anyone else who has built something and deployed it.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re going for the certifications route, it depends on what stack you&rsquo;re going for:</p>

<p>For anything with Spring, go through springsource.com/training you&rsquo;ll find some links there for certification classes.</p>

<p>For anything .NET or Windows, go through microsoft.com/learning for more info.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate the amount of time and money spent on studying/getting a certification. If you already have a job, don&rsquo;t take a certification unless you really plan on moving up some sort of mega-corp corporate ladder, deeply studying a certain 'vertical&rsquo; or if you&rsquo;re targeting another job that requires a certain certification.</p>

<p>If you want to get 'better&rsquo; that has no 'immediate&rsquo; strict commitments:</p>

<ul><li>Find yourself a user-group of your stack</li>
<li>Work with a friend on a project you think is 'cool&rsquo;</li>
<li>Talk to your boss and ask to work on a part of the company system that interests you</li>
<li>Work on some open-source project.</li>
