    <p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to talk to students about the realities of the IT/Software Development industry, a talk that I would have loved to hear when I was a student. God gave me that chance through a friend of mine.</p>

<p>I gave a talk entitled &ldquo;Career Paths: Story-based Career Planning&rdquo; for a host of graduating students in Asia Pacific College.</p>

<p>Depending on the circumstances and unless I need to learn something specific &ndash; it&rsquo;s ridiculous to seriously take career advice from someone who has yet to hit 30:</p>

<p><img src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/dde5fb77a2909259b58993568771d8be/tumblr_inline_n4jirmN7nB1rqf6g8.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lsquo;Who here has no idea what they&rsquo;ll do after graduation?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked.</p>

<p>Most of them laughed and raised their hands. That got them talking, that question got their attention.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t talk as someone with authority, but as someone who is also going through their own career path, someone who is also learning as they go.</p>

<p>I told my story, I told them to learn from it, because it&rsquo;s the most helpful thing they could get from me unless they approach me personally and ask for specific advice.</p>

<p>They wanted a 45 minute talk, I gave a 25 minute one. One thing about giving talks is knowing the context. A bunch of students attending for requirements? In this context, short and sweet is better than long and tedious.</p>

<p>The talk ends up with a single point: Focusing on your 'Career <em>Plan</em>&rsquo; is noteworthy, but what&rsquo;s more important is the character needed in going through your 'Career <em>Path</em>&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Some snippets:</p>

<ul><li>Part of my talk was going back to what the word 'career&rsquo; really meant:</li>
<li><em>Career</em> originates from the latin word <em>carrus</em> (a wheeled vehicle)</li>
<li>The definition of career transformed throughout time, now it&rsquo;s being used to describe one&rsquo;s profession.</li>
<li>Career is also a verb: to move uncontrollably.</li>
<li>I also didn&rsquo;t know what to do after graduation.</li>
<li>Plans are man-made based on ideal expectations, do not follow them to the letter, see them as a guidelines.</li>
<li>Paths are made naturally based on personal character. Exceptional Careers (Yukihiro Matsumoto, Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Martin Odersky, Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, etc.) seemed more of a 'path&rsquo;, not a 'plan&rsquo;. </li>
<li>Character beats ability, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll give up trying to be better at being more able. Work smart.</li>
<li>Be concerned in doing the things you love doing, you&rsquo;ll get highly paid to do these things in the future.</li>
<li>Passion is great, on the other side we also need to be professional. Balance both. What if you don&rsquo;t feel like doing what want to do anymore? Plan around the things you&rsquo;re passionate about. </li>
<li>Applying for a job and going into an interview is the norm after graduation, but it will be the 'exception&rsquo; after working for a couple of years. Work well, work well with others.</li>
<li>Take related tasks that no one wants to do, your value instantly increases.</li>
<li>Do things that are highly valuable for the company. Climb up the value chain, avoid being a 'cost center&rsquo;, attach yourself to 'profit centers&rsquo;. </li>
<li>Avoid 'make work&rsquo;: made-up work to make you look busy. Automate 'make work&rsquo;, and you&rsquo;ll instantly be essential to the organization.</li>
<li>Age is not that important, if you&rsquo;re working with right people.</li>
<li>'You can&rsquo;t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something â€” your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.&rsquo; - Steve Jobs</li>
<li>I placed my trust in God that everything would be alright.</li>
