<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of losing streaks that Filipinos, on a simple level, were emotionally attached to. Manny Pacquiao (Boxing) and Janine (Miss Universe). As life progresses, all of us have go through it once in a while: accepting defeat in daily battles.</p>

<p>People who choose to accept defeat and live life taking lessons from such an event may not get the same recognition as winners from the world. But in the end, you may want to think about it - it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. Crowns decay and trophies get lost after a couple of centuries.</p>

<p>What matters in the end: Did you point to Jesus enough? It matters that we live a life that enjoyed Him in order for Him to be glorified through the light that was shining. Even during defeat.</p>

<p><strong>The sincere acceptance of defeat humbles you enough in order for you to receive a different kind of grace that cannot be experienced by winners. This stance of accepting defeat requires a kind of powerful character that is not attached to any worldly reward.</strong> A different kind of character is needed, one that is attached to living a life of commitment to a craft, attached to a dedicated life in listening and answering God&rsquo;s call.</p>

<p>Accept defeat graciously. Smile, sincerely smile.</p>

<p>Move forward with God.</p>
