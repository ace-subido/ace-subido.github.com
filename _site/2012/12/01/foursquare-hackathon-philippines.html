    <h4>Hackathon</h4>

<p><strong>Hackathon</strong> - apparently to a lot of people, hackathons are a convention of geeks who type mumbo-jumbo into a computer which results into more mumbo-jumbo breaking into computer systems and getting all their stuff.</p>

<p>Though, on the contrary, it&rsquo;s not:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is an event in which computer      programmers and others in the field of software development, like graphic designers, interface designers, project managers and computational philologists[1], collaborate intensively on software projects. - <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Wait, aren&rsquo;t hackers bad?</strong></p>

<p>Well, to straighten things out, let&rsquo;s ask good ol&rsquo; Wikipedia one more time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and stretching their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A hacker is someone who thinks out of the box, to stretch beyond capabilities.</p>

<p>So I wanted to know if I can be a <strong>hacker</strong>, in spirit of such a term - so I joined a hackathon.</p>

<h4>FourSquare Hackathon - Philippines</h4>

<p><img src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mecynuZePG1rqf6g8.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>(<em>Photo from WebGeek</em>)</p>

<p>There were a lot of &lsquo;firsts&rsquo; today:</p>

<ul><li>It was my first hackathon experience ever. </li>
<li>It was FourSquares&rsquo; first Philippine based Hackathon.</li>
<li>It was SMART&rsquo;s first ever partnership with FourSquare.</li>
<li>Maybe it was the first time a lot of people got filmed by a television crew (NET25!)</li>
</ul><p>Me and my teammates roughly had any preparation for it due to schedule, but hey, it was a 200PHP entrance fee, and I might as well get into a &ldquo;first&rdquo;. <strong>In particular to anything in life, it&rsquo;s exciting to have a &ldquo;first&rdquo;, you never really know what you might learn in the end.</strong></p>

<p>Some personal highlights:</p>

<ul><li>I woke up pretty early for this, me and Cawi met up and went to SMART around 830AM. Man the internet there was just crazy, 300MB download in 5minutes.</li>
<li>Theme for the hackathon - It&rsquo;s More Fun in the Philippines. Build something in that theme under nine hours, demo it in a smartphone (Demoed my teams&rsquo; app in a Windows Phone)</li>
<li>Lunch time = energy of the room was at its peak.</li>
<li>Free flowing food!</li>
<li>1 hour before judging = tension.</li>
</ul><p><img src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_meehhfXlzN1rqf6g8.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<ul><li>Presentation = It was pretty dull of me to tell the panel of judges that our app error comes from hitting the API limit, though we were really burning through a lot of requests since the app roughly sends 16 requests, per click of the form. After presenting, under further investigation, I personally approached Sajid Mehmood and told him my findings before they did their judging: the app error came from a wrong looping algorithm in one of our <code>ViewModel</code> classes, he commented: &ldquo;Ah I see, though I still like your concept, I would have used your <a href="http://4sqhackph.karaniwan.org/apps/14/one-day-trip" target="_blank">app</a> when I got here. It&rsquo;s what I need.&rdquo;</li>
</ul><h4>Winning</h4>

<p><img src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mecxn8soMQ1rqf6g8.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>(<em>Photo from WebGeek</em>)</p>

<p>See that picture up there? (I&rsquo;m the one in that red jacket)</p>

<p>In reality, I was a little tense during that time since the Hackathon is around 30minutes to finish, but whenever I see this candid blurred photo of mine, I see genuine enjoyment. It wasn&rsquo;t fun, but it was joy for me. There&rsquo;s a big difference in that.</p>

<p>After the announcement of the winners and learning that we clearly lost, I was feeling a little down, but only for a few seconds. I realized that from the first hour of participating in the Hackathon, everyone had already won.</p>

<ul><li>Winning the competition against themselves.</li>
<li>Winning the battle for focus.</li>
<li>Winning the struggle of stagnation.</li>
<li>(I haven&rsquo;t included people getting free t-shirts, woohoo!!)</li>
</ul><p>They learned how they &ldquo;really&rdquo; work, they learned how they &ldquo;speak&rdquo; towards a panel of judges about their app, they learned about what they really &ldquo;know&rdquo; about developing an app in their chosen language, but mostly it&rsquo;s not about that. Everyone learned a lot, not necessarily in honing their respective skills, but most importantly, everyone learned a lot about themselves.</p>

<p>To some, it seems embarrassing to be still learning, <a href="http://acesubido.com/2012/11/28/pride-the-simplicity.html" target="_blank">but there&rsquo;s no time for embarrassment, even at age 40.</a></p>

<p>You would most certainly agree, when people reflect on what happened and what they learned from themselves during those 9 hours - that&rsquo;s a win right there. That&rsquo;s worth <strong>a whole lot</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>In particular to anything in life, it&rsquo;s exciting to have a &ldquo;first&rdquo;, you never really know what you might learn in the end.</strong></p>
